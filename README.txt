This is a visualization of Literacy rates for Latin American and Caribbean countries. 
I used python, matplotlib, and numpy to create the visualization. 
The data came from https://cia.gov. (direct link: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/rawdata_2103.txt)
I created this visualization to show the differences in literacy rates between other Latin American countries
and Haiti.
